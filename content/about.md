Jim Grundyâ€™s paintings can appear to be in the tradition of hard edged geometric abstraction but the contrast between the fluid surfaces and areas of intense colour and their relationships are rooted in observation
of the real world. Compositions are developed from a diverse range of sources including architecture, historic artefacts and landscapes. The paintings are inspired by the relationship between the colours and geometry found in the natural and built environment. 

The interaction between chance and control is a significant factor in the development of each work. The chance element is characterised by allowing the paint to drip and pool under gravity. The control element involves precise preliminary drawings usually mapped out on graph paper then transferred onto the paint surface. In time the balance between the colour intensity, shape, size and texture of each element crystallises.
